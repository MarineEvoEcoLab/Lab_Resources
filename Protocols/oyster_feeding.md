# Protocol for oyster feeding
This protocol walks through the feeding of adult broodstock oysters and oyster larvae through development to juveniles. All algal foods (Shellfish Diet 1800 and pure algal cultures) can be found in the yellow refrigerator outside of Blount 104. There will be a carboy of Type I DI water in the Aquarium building near the broodstock tank, in Blount 104, or for now there are smaller bottles in the yellow fridge.

## Adult broodstock feeding
For the adult oysters, we use [Shellfish Diet 1800](https://reedmariculture.com/products/shellfish-diet) (Isochrysis, Pavlova, Tetraselmis, Thalassiosira weissflogii and Thalassiosira psuedonana). While conditioning for spawning, we'll feed broodstock daily using the steps outlined below:
1. Before feeding, you'll want to clean the tank of debris, psuedofeces, and feces. To do so use the handheld plastic siphon to siphon up unwanted debris into a bucket or the outflow drain.
2. Measure out the Shellfish Diet slurry in graduated cylinder (account for 0.5ml per adult; e.g. for 100 oysters, you would measure out 50ml) and pour into wide mouthed container or bottle.
3. Dilute Shellfish Diet to a 1:10 concentration in DI water (important that the water is free of Ca++ or Fe+++, as these ions will result in clumping of the cells). For example, you would measure out and add 500ml of DI water to the wide mouthed container with the Shellfish Diet.
4. Mix diluted cells very well.
5. Pour diluted mix through 20 micron sieve into the tank, making sure to move around to all parts of the tank. The sieve will help to catch any big clumps of cells.
6. Clean graduated cylinder, bottle, and sieve in freshwater after feeding and place in bin to dry.
7. Return Shellfish Diet to refrigerator in Blount and return siphon to Blount 104.
