# Protocol for oyster feeding

#### Version 1.0.0

This protocol walks through the feeding of adult broodstock oysters and oyster larvae through development to juveniles. All algal foods (Shellfish Diet 1800 and pure algal cultures) can be found in the yellow refrigerator outside of Blount 104. There will be a carboy of Type I DI water in the Aquarium building near the broodstock tank, in Blount 104, or for now there are smaller bottles in the yellow fridge.

## Adult broodstock feeding

For the adult oysters, we use [Shellfish Diet 1800](https://reedmariculture.com/products/shellfish-diet) (Isochrysis, Pavlova, Tetraselmis, Thalassiosira weissflogii and Thalassiosira psuedonana). While conditioning for spawning, we'll feed broodstock daily using the steps outlined below:
1. Before feeding, you'll want to clean the tank of debris, psuedofeces, and feces. To do so use the handheld plastic siphon to siphon up unwanted debris into a bucket or the outflow drain.
2. Measure out the Shellfish Diet slurry in graduated cylinder (account for 0.5ml per adult; e.g. for 100 oysters, you would measure out 50ml) and pour into wide mouthed container or bottle.
3. Dilute Shellfish Diet to a 1:10 concentration in DI water (important that the water is free of Ca++ or Fe+++, as these ions will result in clumping of the cells). For example, you would measure out and add 500ml of DI water to the wide mouthed container with the Shellfish Diet.
4. Mix diluted cells very well.
5. Pour diluted mix through 20 micron sieve into the tank, making sure to move around to all parts of the tank. The sieve will help to catch any big clumps of cells.
6. Clean graduated cylinder, bottle, and sieve in freshwater after feeding and place in bin to dry.
7. Mark on the whiteboard schedule that oysters where fed for that day.
8. Return Shellfish Diet to refrigerator in Blount and return siphon to Blount 104.

## Larvae feeding

For larvae, we use [Isochrysis](https://reedmariculture.com/collections/bivalve-hatchery-feeds/products/isochrysis) and [Pavlova](https://reedmariculture.com/collections/bivalve-hatchery-feeds/products/pavlova) from Reed Mariculture. We've feed the larval buckets daily, using the steps outlined below:
1. Before feeding, you'll want to remove and clean the banjo filter in each bucket. Do this treatment by treatment.
Use the PVC caps to quickly cap off the 1/2" pipe after removing the banjo.
After removing the banjo, spray it off with filtered seawater into the bucket to remove any larvae that could be stuck to it.
Spray off the banjo with tap water on high flow making sure to remove any debris.
Rinse banjo in filtered seawater and return to bucket.
2. For feeding 9 buckets, measure out 18mL DI water in a graduated cylinder.
3. Pipette 900uL of Iso and 900uL of Pavlova into the DI water, using a new tip each time. Be sure to pipette up and down to fully empty the tip.
4. Dilute mix up to 36mL with DI water.
5. Transfer 4mL of diluted mix to a falcon tube and add roughly 40mL filtered seawater.
6. Pour mixture in the falcon tube through a 25 micron sieve into the bucket.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for each bucket.
8. Rinse all supplies and return to bin.
