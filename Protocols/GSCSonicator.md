## Protocol For Sonicator in the Genomics and Sequencing Core

### Get tubes from Janet Atoyan in GSC or order [LINK] (http://covaris.corecommerce.com/microTUBE-AFA-Fiber-Pre-Slit-Snap-Cap-6x16mm-25-p23.html)

**If you plan to sonicate in the morning tell Janet the day before and she will turn on the machine when she leaves. The machine needs at least 4 hours to cool down the water temp to ~6°C, you also need to turn on the computer 30 minutes before starting. Prepare you time appropriately**
* Create numbering system with 1-x for your samples and number Covaris tubes appropirately. There is very little room on the Covaris tubes for writing 
* Calculate the volume of DNA and Nuclease-free H2O for each sample. The total volume needs to be 50μl in each tube. The amount of DNA in each tube should be the same (ex. 1μg)
* Covaris tubes fit in the navy and orange tip box in the lab, use this to hold the tubes
* Prepare diluted DNA in separate PCR strip tubes so that the whole sample can be added to the Covaris tubes in one step
* When adding to the Covaris tubes, use a p200 pipette and suck up all of the sample to be added. Puncture the top of the Covaris tube with the pipette tip, push down until the tip of tip is close to the bottom of the tube and depress the plunger to add the sample. There will be resistance to pushing the tip into the tube
* Once all samples are added, spin down in the big centrifuge to make sure all the samples are at the bottom of the tubes
* In the GSC, set the sonicator protocol to what you want (ex. 150bp with 50μl sample), if you need to create a new protocol use the binder in the drawer next to the machine to find the correct setting values
* Change the water in the basin with type II DI water about to level 12. The water level needs to be higher than the liquid level in the tube, but not too high to get into the tube
* Make sure the degas pump is turned ON
* Check the interface on the program to make sure that every thing is on and square; there should be no red icons
* Lift the small lid and take out the tube holder, slide in the first tube until it snaps into place and is secure. Put the holder back into the machine and close the lid. Make sure the program registers that you closed the lid
* Press start on the computer and move the curser away from the icon (it turns to a stop button and you don't want to accidentally hit it)
* The program will take about 2 minutes
* Once done remove the tube the same way you put it in, wipe excess water off with a Kimwipe, and do the next sample
* Once all samples are done, shut of the water chiller. Turn off the degas pump from the computer interface and remove the basin and pour out the water
* Put the basin back in and set the system right. Make sure it fits properly. Turn the degas pump back on to push out any extra water in the tubing. If it won't turn on it is becuase the water basin isn't sitting right in the system. Turn it off again after no more water comes out. Then you can shut down the program and the machine
* Pour out excess water and leave the system propped open by jamming a Kimwipe box in between the two components to facilitate drying
* With your samples, re-centrifuge briefly to bring all the liquid down 
* Take the cap off the tubes one at a time and remove all liquid and place in labeled PCR strip tubes that will be easier to work with later on
