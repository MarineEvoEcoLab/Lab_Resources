# 0.4X Bead Cleanup for Nanopore Sequencing

#### Place beads at RT 30 minutes before use to allow them to equilibrate! 
#### Make fresh 80% EtOH 

## Protocol
1.	Add 0.45X beads to DNA. (If 100uL DNA, add 45uL beads)
2.	Mix GENTLY by stirring with pipet tip or flicking
3.	Leave at RT 20 minutes on nutating mixer
4.	Place on magnet for 10 minutes
5.	Remove supernatant. This can be retained in a new tube if there are concerns about sample loss.
6.	Add 200uL of 80% EtOH, pipetting against the front wall of the tube, and wait 30 seconds (tube still on magnetic rack)
7.	Remove supernatant
8.	Add 200uL of 80% EtOH again, wait 30 seconds
9.	Remove supernatant
10.	Spin the tube quickly (mini-fuge, or a “short” up to 3000xg)
11.	Place tube on magnetic rack, pipet off any residual ethanol with a p10 and fine tip
12.	Allow tube to dry open on magnetic rack for 1 minute.
13.	Remove tube from rack. Add 50 uL EB, Tris, or H20.
14.	Gently flick tube until pellet comes off the side, and continue flicking until no bits of pellet are visible. Do not pipet up and down, but a pipet tip can be used to stir stubborn pellets gently.
15.	Place tube in rack and leave for 20 minutes undisturbed to elute long fragments. Then leave tube on the nutating mixer at RT for at least 20 minutes (**up to overnight**) to elute DNA off beads. Longer times are necessary for longer fragments.
16.	Place tube on magnetic rack, and wait ~5-10 minutes for liquid to go clear.
17.	Gently pipet liquid into a new, labeled tube.
