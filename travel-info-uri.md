### Before Travel

For travel with/for URI you will have to get access via eCampus to the URI financials login: [access form](https://web.uri.edu/controller/files/PS-Fin-Access-Form-Oct2016-1.pdf). You will be requesting access to the travel and expense module only.
"For access to PeopleSoft Financials, submit the PS Financials Request for Security Access form, and check the T&E user box. For student access, a supervisor and a delegate must be provided on the form. The supervisor should be the student’s professor, and the delegate should be an administrative person from within the department.
Email completed forms to financials_e-campus@etal.uri.edu. Once you’ve received approval, log into e-Campus and select the “Change Password” option from the main menu. The user must change their password in e-Campus to create a user ID and password in PeopleSoft Financials that will mirror the e-Campus credentials. Once in PeopleSoft Financials, travelers will use the Travel and Expense Module to add delegates, create a travel authorization (TA), and set up direct deposit to expedite the reimbursement process."

**At least 2 weeks** before travel you will need to fill out a Travel Authorization form. Confirm with Hollie what will go on it (i.e. all expenses), the cost, and which funding program it will come from. This will need to be submitted and then approved before travel. Enter trip expenses that will be incurred, estimating with the best information available at the time the TA is created.
Information needed to complete a TA includes:
- Destination and approximate travel dates
- Funding source for each expense (Chartfield String)
- Business purpose/justification of travel
- Cost estimates for all anticipated expenses (e.g., airfare, lodging, registration)
- Payment method for each expense (e.g., URI TCard, personal cash/credit card)

### While Traveling

Keep ALL receipts! Request receipts when not given them. As a general rule do not charge food/beverages to the hotel.

"Travelers are required to submit paper expense reports with original receipts attached in addition to submitting the electronic form with receipts attached online. The report should be forwarded to the URI Travel Office, 103 Carlotti Administration Building."

### Once Returned

You will have to fill out the Expense report (ER) form. Photocopy/scan all receipts and attach them to the ER under the associated item and this will be submitted via the online form. Additionally you need to hand in all hard copies of the receipts to Denise Brown or Marianne Prior (4th floor administrative offices: drbrown@uri.edu and mariannep@uri.edu)

"In order to be reimbursed for travel expenses, the traveler must scan all itemized receipts, attach them to an Expense Report (ER) in the online travel module and submit the ER for approval.  A printed copy of the ER along with all original receipts must then be submitted to the URI Travel Office, 103 Carlotti Administration Building.  We highly recommend travelers set up their bank accounts in the module to receive direct deposits for travel-related reimbursements."
