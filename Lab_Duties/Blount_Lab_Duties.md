# Lab Duties and Tasks for Bay Campus Lab
**The Mitochondria (Blount 104, Aquarium Bldg)**\
*Lab members responsible: Amy, Megan, Gabe*

## Ordering for the Bay Campus
*updated 11/24/2021*\
For ease of delivery, almost all packages for the Bay Campus lab are delivered to the main lab at CBLS, picked up, and brought to the Bay Campus.
Ordering can be done online through established accounts in the shared PLOMME purchasing folder. All orders must be tax exempt.
### Guide to receiving packages
[Comprehensive protocol for processing packages at CBLS](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols_and_Lab_Resources/Lab_Maintenance/Putting_Away_Packages.md). The only major addition to this would be storing packing slips *(see next section)*.
### Storing packing slips
* Place the packing slip in the folder labeled "Puritz" on the file cabinet next to Maggie's old desk in the desk area.
* Lab member responsible for packing slips at CBLS will scan and send all packing slips to Colleen at the end of each week.
### Returning items
If you have to return anything via Amazon, follow the returns prompts for that item. If the item is being returned without a provided shipping label, reference this [Sending Packages file](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols_and_Lab_Resources/Lab_Maintenance/Sending_Packages.md) for instructions on generating a shipping label and ship out your package.

## Airgas ordering and receiving
*updated 11/24/2021*
* Ordering CO2 and N2 from Airgas as needed using this [template email](Airgas_order.md)
* Make sure to be at the Blount lab for the delivery day
* Disconnect regulator from empty cylinders and cap empty cylinders double checking that they are labeled "empty"
* After the arrival of the cylinders, ensure that they are secured to the wall and tag them as "full" using the white tags provided by Airgas
* Once secured, attach them to the regulator, tightening the connection with a wrench
* Carefully and *slowly* turn on the gas by opening the valve fully to the left then do one half turn to the right
* Listen and feel for leaks all the way down the line (regulator to solenoids)
### Airgas receipts
* Upon delivery of the cylinders, the carrier will leave a receipt
* Take a picture of the receipt, convert to a pdf and send the pdf in the *#grad_students* slack channel
  * From there it will be sent to with other packing slips to Colleen
