Your safety in our lab is our top priority, and you have the right to know the chemicals present in our lab, their risks, and the training and skills to work with anything in the lab.

**Before anyone begins labwork in the wet lab, it is mandatory that they through the lab safety orientation checklist with the Lab Manager Maggie Schedl, talk to her in person or email (meschedl@uri.edu) to set up a time.**

**Safety Trainings Required at URI**
- Initial Lab Safety and Hazardous Waste Management
      - Use [URI Training Schedules Website](https://web.uri.edu/ehs/training_schedule/) to view all trainings
      - Use [Registration Form](https://web.uri.edu/ehs/training_registration_form/) to sign up for a class
      - Refresher class to take every year after the first class, register via [form](https://web.uri.edu/ehs/training_registration_form/) and class will be granted through online portal
- [PDF of initial hazardous waste safety course](https://web.uri.edu/ehs/files/InitialSlides.pdf)
- [CITI Responsible Conduct of Research training](https://web.uri.edu/research-admin/office-of-research-integrity/responsible-conduct-research/)

### [ONLINE HAZARDOUS WASTE PICKUP FORM](https://web.uri.edu/ehs/online-pickup/)
If you fill your hazardous waste container, please either request the pickup yourself or tell Maggie as soon as you realize. Pick ups are only once every two weeks on Thursdays.

If you have questions about if your protocol/procedure generates a hazardous waste first look at the documents that are available with the components. All kits have an SDS (safety data sheet) even if there isn't anything hazardous in them, these should be available on the website where they are from. Additionally, you could just google components to look for SDSs. You should also talk to Maggie about generating hazardous wastes. You also need to pay attention to the container you put the waste in, some chemicals cannot be stored plastic containers.
The URI Environmental Health and Safety staff are also very responsive over email : Nancy Paterson (nancy_paterson@uri.edu), Connie Heird (cheird@uri.edu), Abigail Bernier (akbernier@uri.edu).
