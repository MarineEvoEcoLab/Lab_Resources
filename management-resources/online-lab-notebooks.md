**OnlineLab Notebooks**

Credit: This notebook is built with Jekyll Now forked from Barry Clark https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now and improved with edited material from a variety of online lab notebook layouts. Thanks to all.

**How to set up your online lab notebook**

- [Forking and customizing notebook repository instructions from Maggie Schedl](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Exercises_And_Instructions/Forked-Notebook-Repository-And-Site-Instructions.md)
- [Making online notebook protocol from Kevin Wong](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resourses/Laboratory_Notebooks/Github-Notebook-Protocol.md)
- These are both for the same style notebook, however there are other style "jekyll blogs" that can be coerced into a notebook-like format.

Our notebooks are written in markdown format. Here are some resources on how to write with markdown syntax:
- [Markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
- [Markdown syntax guide](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)
- [Markdown reference sheet](https://wordpress.com/support/markdown-quick-reference/)

You write a markdown file in a text editor application. Here are some options:
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/support/bbedit/updates.html)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)


**Very important: having an online lab notebook is NOT substituable for having a physical lab notebook. The purpose for this is knowlege sharing and reproducibly only.**
