## Course Description
Study of the general biology and evolutionary relationship of the invertebrate animals. Laboratory sessions include concurrent comparative study of selected examples and field trips to local environments.

Throughout the semester we will focus on the ecology, evolution, behavior, physiology, anatomy, and development of a cross section of "invertebrate" animals. With approximately 2 to >10 MILLION species of invertebrates, across approximately 35 phyla, all occupying this planet alongside us rare vertebrates, this course will be broad survey of the majority of biodiversity on our planet.

## Course Goals and Student Learning Outcomes
The overall outcome of this course is to promote the knowledge and understanding of 99% of all animal biodiversity, including morphology, life-history, ecology, and evolution.  In order to master this material, the outcomes of BIO 354 include that students acquire factual knowledge, synthesize taxonmic relationships based on shared and derived characteristics, and gain an appreciation for the breadth of diversity.

After completing this course, students should be able to:
* Identify virtually any invertebrate specimen to Phylum and Class
* Identify shared and derived characteristics of Classes, Phyla, and larger phylogentic groupings
* Synthesize all taxonomic knowledge to understand larger evolutionary patterns

## Readings
Required readings will be assigned weekling from recent primary scientific literature corresponding to the taxonomic group being covered.  

An optional but recommended text is *Biology of the Invertebrates*, by Jan Pechenik (7th edition).  The corresponding chapters (indicated on the syllabus) will give a distinct advantage towards understanding the course material.  The exceptions are current phylogenetic relationships and larger taxonmic classification/organization.  Recent advances in molecular and genomic techniques have lead to rapid advancement in the field which will be captured by the assigned primary literature

Lastly, lecture PowerPoints, past exams, films, web sites and supporting material will all be included on Sakai.  *It is your responsibility to log in to Sakai **daily** and be up to date with all information posted pertaining to class.*

|2nd Exam| 15%|
|Final Exam| 30%|
|Laboratory Grade (See Below for breakdown)| 30%|

#### Lecture Exams
The exams focus on taxonomic relationships, adaptation, functional biology and ecology.  They will be comprised of short answer and essay questions.  Exams are scheduled well in advance and cannot be taken at another time.  If you must miss one, you must notify Dr. Puritz prior to the exam.  In the event of a pre-scheduled, pre-notified excused absence, or a documented illness, a make-up exam will be administered.

### Letter Grade Conversion

Letter grades will be assigned following the chart below:

|Grade| % |Grade| % |Grade| % |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|A+	|98-100| A	|93-97|A-	|90-92|
|B+	|88-89| B	|83-87| B-	|80-82|

#### Participation 
Attendance and participation are mandatory.  University excused absences with at least two weeks advance notice may be rescheduled or otherwise accommodated at the discretion of the instructor. Students will receive participation points for each laboratory meeting in which you actively contribute.  Active participation includes working well with lab partners and classmates, learning all required skills, taking notes, taking part in relevant discussions and working until the end of class. Students will lose participation points if they are late.  Noticeable absence of general participation, as defined above, will result loss of points for that exercise. 

#### Laboratory Practicals
There will be two practical exams during the semester.  These will cover the material learned in lab.  Students will be responsible for knowing correct nomenclature of the organisms studied including their anatomy and defining features.  In order to be prepared for these exams, students need to pay close attention in each lab, knowing all highlighted material and performing all directed tasks.  Due to the complexity of setting up a practical there are no makeup practicals.  You must attend unless you have a University Sanctioned reason for missing (refer to student handbook). 

#### Laboratory Quizes
There will be approximately 6-8 short quizzes throughout the semester.  They will be at the start of the lab, but will not be scheduled in advance.  The quiz will cover material from both the previous lab and, possibly, background material for the exercise to be performed that day, if provided.  This means that students must be familiar with the day's lab material before class.  Quizzes will be at the beginning of lab and take 10 mins.  There will be no make up quizzes, and tardiness will result in less time to complete the quiz.

## Lab Guidelines
**Dress appropriately:** closed-toed shoes, long pants, and safety goggles/glasses (without these the student will be dismissed from lab). Long hair should be tied back.  Failure to meet safety standards will result in being sent home by the laboratory instructor and losing all participation points for that lab.

**Be prepared:** Students are required to purchase a dissection kit, available at the URI bookstore. It is also recommended but not required to purchase the great coloring books by Lawrence M. Elson, such as The Zoology Coloring Book, available for cheap on Amazon. Students must bring a copy of the lab, a notebook, and writing utensils to lab and read the assigned lab before coming to class.  

**Be clean and Safe** the laboratory atmosphere will remain academic, safe, and orderly always.
* Disruptive or foolish behavior will not be tolerated and will result in: dismissal from lab and will count as an absence.
* Food and drinks (including water) are not allowed in the lab at any time
* Students must help to take care of the equipment used in the lab activities and keep them clean and organized.

## Accommodations

Any student with a documented disability is welcome to contact me as early in the semester as possible so that we may arrange reasonable accommodations. As part of this process, please be in touch with Disability Services for Students Office at 330 Memorial Union, 401-874-2098 (http://www.uri.edu/disabilittddss/) or the Academic Skills Center, 239 Shepard Building, Alan Shawn Feinstein Providence Campus, 401-277-5221 
(http://web.uri.edu/ceps/academic-skills-center/). 

"Section 504 of the Rehabilitation act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 require the University of Rhode Island to provide academic adjustments or the accommodations for students with documented disabilities. The student with a disability shall be responsible for self-identification to the Disability Services for Students in the Office of Student Life, providing appropriate documentation of disability, requesting accommodation in a timely manner, and follow-through regarding accommodations requested."  It is the student's responsibility to make arrangements for any special needs and the instructor's responsibility to accommodate them with the assistance of the Office of Disability Services for Students. More resources are available here: http://web.uri.edu/disability/

## Course Assistance
This is a challenging course. Success requires that you keep pace with the work, understand course concepts, and study effectively. The Academic Enhancement Center helps URI students succeed through three services: Academic Coaching, Tutoring, and The Writing Center. To learn more about any of these services, please visit web.uri.edu/aec or call 401-874- 2367 to speak with reception staff In Providence, the Academic Skills Center (ASC) is at 239 Shepard Building, (401) 277-5221. Hours are posted each semester at http://web.uri.edu/ceps/academic-skills-center/

## Conduct and Behavior
Students are expected to treat faculty and fellow classmates with dignity and respect.  Students are responsible for being familiar with and adhering to the published "Student Code of Conduct" which can be accessed in the University Student Handbook (http://web.uri.edu/studentconduct/student-handbook/).  If you must come in late, please do not disrupt the class. Please turn off all cell phones, e-watches, or any electronic devices.

## Academic Honesty
Students are expected to be honest in all academic work. A student’s name on any written work, quiz or exam shall be regarded as assurance that the work is the result of the student’s own independent thought and study. Work should be stated in the student’s own words, properly attributed to its source.   Students have an obligation to know how to quote, paraphrase, summarize, cite and reference the work of others with integrity. The following are examples of academic dishonesty.

* Using material, directly or paraphrasing, from published sources (print or electronic) without appropriate citation

* Claiming disproportionate credit for work not done independently

* Unauthorized possession or access to exams

* Unauthorized communication during exams

* Unauthorized use of another’s work or preparing work for another student

* Taking an exam for another student

* Altering or attempting to alter grades

* The use of notes or electronic devices to gain an unauthorized advantage during exams

* Fabricating or falsifying facts, data or references

* Facilitating or aiding another’s academic dishonesty

* Submitting the same paper for more than one course without prior approval from the instructors.
